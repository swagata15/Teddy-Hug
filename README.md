# Teddy-Hug
Intention There is an increasing number of couples who either due to work, education opportunities or situations that are out of their hands find themselves in long distance relationships. One of the key factors that sustains a long distance relationship is frequent communication that feels intimate and personal. While there are a lot of different means of communication available, there aren’t any communication means where the object of communication reminds the person of their significant other.  ⌃ 0 ⌄ Context This paired device, a pair of two teddy bears, helps a student who just got arrested after a demonstration connect with his wife in a subtle and rudimentary but powerful way. It helps him convey that he is thinking about her with just a few lines of recorded message that are very personal to his partner. He is in a situation where no smart phones or laptops are allowed.
